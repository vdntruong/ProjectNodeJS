## About BigBug

BigBug is a web application framework base on Express JS, elegant syntax. I believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. BigBug takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Simple, fast routing engine.
- Powerful dependency injection container.
- Multiple back-ends for session and cache storage.
- Real-time event with [Socket.io](https://socket.io/).

BigBug is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
